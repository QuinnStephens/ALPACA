ALPACA is the Actionscript LDU Point And Click Adventure game engine (LDU stands for Laser Dragon University, the animated web series for which I initially developed the engine). It lets you create 2D point-and-click adventure games like Monkey Island or King's Quest without having to do much coding. It's open source and free for everyone.

Right now it requires Adobe Flash CS5 or greater to use. Older releases are still available on the project home page (see below).

The engine is still primitive and a bit limiting, but work is underway on more advanced versions. For all updates, source code, tutorials and documentation, visit http://alpacaengine.com.
